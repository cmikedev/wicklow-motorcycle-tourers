# Wicklow Motorcycle Tourers
Wicklow Motorcycle Tourers is the website for a motorcycle touring group based in Wicklow, Ireland. The intention of this [site](https://cmikedev.github.io/wicklow-motorcycle-tourers/) is to provide an overview of the meeting location and ride times for riders who wish to tour Wicklow with other like-minded riders and make use of a roadside bike shed.

The purpose of the site was to ultimately get users to sign up with the group. Given the nature of the group's activities (i.e. being dependant on weather conditions), only the bare minimum details of the weekly meet ups would be posted to the site with the intention that a user would sign up and receive detailed emails on each upcoming weekly meet.

## Features

* ### Navigation Bar

    • The navigation bar is featured on all pages where there is click-access. It is not featured on the "Thank You" page which is only accessed via completion of the sign up form.

    • This allows the user to navigate across the website without having to use their browser's back button. The page name in the navigation bar is underlined when the user hovers over that page and is permanently underlined when a user is on that page allowing them to easily see where they are.

* ### Page Videos

    * Each page contains a video which was chosen to create a sense of motion through the site and elicit a sense of companionship and belonging and a desire in the user to get onto their bikes, thus going to the sign up page.

* ### Main Text

    * Overlaying each video is a text box providing an introductory welcome to the section as well as a link to the next page facilitating the users journey to the sign up form. The text boxes overlaying the videos are relatively opaqe and off-set so as to be obvious, legible but not interfere with the sense of motion created by the video.

    * The 'Sign Up' page differs in that the text box which contains the sign up form is centred rather than off-set and is not opaque. This is because the user will have reached our intended destination and so the sign up form is styled to stand out over the video in order to capture and hold their attention.

### Structure
The navigation bar at the top is minimalistic and clear, enabling users to easily navigate to each page and highlighting the page that they are on. 

Each page contains a video which was chosen to create a sense of motion through the site and elicit a desire in the user to get onto their bikes. The text boxes overlaying these are relatively opaqe and off-set so as to be obvious, legible but not interfere with the sense of motion created by the video. Each text box contains a link to the next page.

Below the videos there is also some additional information (with the exception of the 'Bike Shed' and 'Sign Up' pages) with a further link to the next page.

The 'Sign Up' page differs in that the text box which contains the sign up form is centred rather than off-set and is not opaque. This is because the user will have reached our intended destination and so the sign up form is styled to stand out over the video in order to capture and hold their attention.

### Styling
The colour palette is very subdued with only white, black and shades of grey being utilised. This was to frame the navigation, text and footer in a clear, clean way whilst maximising the sense of flow and engagement provided by the video.

Of the fonts available on Google Fonts I chose 'Lobster'. The stylised, italic nature of this font is one that is common to many motorcycle-centered websites, tshirts and other visuals and so might elicit a sense of familiarity to motorcycle riders.
