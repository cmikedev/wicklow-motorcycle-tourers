Wicklow Motorcycle Tourers is a fictional website for a motorcycle touring group based in Wicklow, Ireland. The intention of this [site](https://cmikedev.github.io/wicklow-motorcycle-tourers/) is to provide an overview of the meeting location and ride times for riders who wish to tour Wicklow with other like-minded riders and make use of a roadside bike shed.
