# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials
Wicklow Motorcycle Tourers is a fictional website for a motorcycle touring group based in Wicklow, Ireland. The intention of this [site](https://cmikedev.github.io/wicklow-motorcycle-tourers/) is to provide an overview of the meeting location and ride times for riders who wish to tour Wicklow with other like-minded riders and make use of a roadside bike shed.

## UX

### Concept
The purpose of the site was to ultimately get users to sign up with the group. Given the nature of the group's activities (i.e. being dependant on weather conditions), only the bare minimum details of the weekly meet ups would be posted to the site with the intention that a user would sign up and receive detailed emails on each upcoming weekly meet.

To achieve this the user is given small amounts of text/detail accompanied by a link to the next page culminating in a sign up form.

### Structure
The navigation bar at the top is minimalistic and clear, enabling users to easily navigate to each page and highlighting the page that they are on. 

Each page contains a video which was chosen to create a sense of motion through the site and elicit a desire in the user to get onto their bikes. The text boxes overlaying these are relatively opaqe and off-set so as to be obvious, legible but not interfere with the sense of motion created by the video. Each text box contains a link to the next page.

Below the videos there is also some additional information (with the exception of the 'Bike Shed' and 'Sign Up' pages) with a further link to the next page.

The 'Sign Up' page differs in that the text box which contains the sign up form is centred rather than off-set and is not opaque. This is because the user will have reached our intended destination and so the sign up form is styled to stand out over the video in order to capture and hold their attention.

### Styling
The colour palette is very subdued with only white, black and shades of grey being utilised. This was to frame the navigation, text and footer in a clear, clean way whilst maximising the sense of flow and engagement provided by the video.

Of the fonts available on Google Fonts I chose 'Lobster'. The stylised, italic nature of this font is one that is common to many motorcycle-centered websites, tshirts and other visuals and so might elicit a sense of familiarity to motorcycle riders.
